# mongoScrapeHW

Scraping Articles, no band-aids required.

Technology Used:

    - Cheerio
    - Node.js
    - Express.js
    - MongoDB
    - Handlebars.js
    - JavaScript
    - Mongoose
    - AJAX/JSON
    - Bootstrap/CSS
    - HTML5

This app utilizes Cheerio to scrape webpages for useful/desired content.  Users are then given the option to save articles they find appealing, allowing them to enjoy it at a later time.  

Constantly connected to the New York Times webpage, users can scrape the front page news at anypoint they desire.  Great for bookmarking specific articles!

Though not functional at the moment, I hope to add a comment function in the near future, in which users can add a custom note to saved articles.
